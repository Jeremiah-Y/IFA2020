Panasonic has confirmed that it's going to be announcing the Lumix S5. Normally we'd have expected this to be showcased at IFA, but this time Panasonic is hosting its own event to reveal its latest camera. We don't know if Panasonic will be making other announcements, often there's an update on TV at IFA too.
