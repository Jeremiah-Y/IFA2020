_9 September 2020_

Motorola launches a lot of phones and it has an event booked for just after IFA on 9 September. We already know that's going to be for the next version of the Moto Razr, its folding phone. Whether there will be another launch we don't know - rumours of the Moto G9 Plus launch are also circulating.
