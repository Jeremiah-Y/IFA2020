Sony Mobile normally uses IFA to launch an update to one of its devices and we'd guess that to be the Xperia 5 II, it's smaller flagship phone. Whether that will happen or not we don't yet know. Sony also updates TVs and sometimes some of its audio offerings, but currently there's no word on plans from the brand.
