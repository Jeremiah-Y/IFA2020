[[4 IFA 2020 品牌列表|<品牌列表]]

HMD Global has been a little quiet recently. Having missed the chance to launch at MWC 2020, we saw the Nokia 5.3 and Nokia 8.3 announced. There's rumours of the Nokia 7.3 now circulating as well as the ominous Nokia 9.3 PureView. We originally thought these might appear at IFA 2020, but we've not heard anything for a while from HMD Global.
