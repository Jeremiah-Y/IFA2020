Garmin often uses IFA to show off a range of new devices and there's no telling where Garmin may focus its efforts - although the Forerunner 45 Plus recently appeared with no word on Garmin. The area we're expecting updates is around the Forerunner 645 Music, which is now one of the older devices in Garmin's line-up.
