Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon will be the speaker at the opening keynote for IFA 2020. Amon will likely talk about the challenges the industry has faced before focusing on 5G. That's likely to be about bringing 5G into a new more affordable segment which has been a trend of smartphones in 2020. We're not expecting many new product announcements but we could see some Snapdragon 690 devices launch at IFA, with Qualcomm in support.
